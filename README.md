## Pool

  A Generic Resource Pool.

```js
  var pool = require('jacuzzi').Pool
```

### new Pool(opts)

  Instantiate a new Pool.

  **Options:**

  - **min** (default: 2) - minimum number of active resources in pool at any given time
  - **max** (default: 10) - maximum number of concurrently active resources
  - **create** - a function that creates new resources (could return a new resource directly or a `Promise`)
  - **destroy** - a function that is used to destroy resources (could return a `Promise` for asynchronous destruction)
  - **check** - a function that is used to check a resource (should return a `true` if the resource is OK, or otherwise `false`; for asynchronous checks it could also return a `Promise`)
  - **events** (default: close, end, error, timeout) - a list of events that are listened to on each resource and - if called - lead to the destruction of the resource
  - **creationTimeout** (default: 500ms) - a timeout (in ms) for the creation of a resource
  - **destructionTimeout** (default: 500ms) - a timeout (in ms) for the destruction of a resource
  - **acquisitionTimeout** (default: 10000) -  a timeout (in ms) for the acquisition of a resource
  - **leakDetectionThreshold** (default: 30.000) - an amount (in ms) of time that a resource can be in use out of the pool before a error is thrown indicating a possible resource leak. (0 = disabled)
  - **faultTolerance** (default: true) - whether the pool just logs errors and retries creation on errors automatically

### pool.acquire([callback])

  This method is used to acquire / request a resource from the pool. It returns a `Promise`. As soon as there is a resource available, the `Promise` gets resolved and (if provided) the `callback` called.

### pool.release(resource)

  This method is used to release / return a `resource` back to the pool.

### pool.drain()

  Gracefully shut down the pool.
