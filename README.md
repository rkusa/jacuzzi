# jacuzzi

A generic resource pool and balancer.

[![NPM][npm]](https://npmjs.org/package/jacuzzi)
[![Build Status][travis]](http://travis-ci.org/rkusa/jacuzzi)

Inspired by [@coopernurse](https://github.com/coopernurse)'s [node-pool](https://github.com/coopernurse/node-pool) but with an additional balancer layer and Promises (API supports both callbacks and Promises).

**Caution:** This project is in early stages. It'll be battle tested in next couple of weeks. If you run into misbehavior, try setting `DEBUG=jacuzzi:*`. Feedback of any kind is welcome.

## Pool

A Generic Resource Pool.

```js
var Pool = require('jacuzzi').Pool
```

### new Pool([name], opts, [args...])

Instantiates a new Pool. If given, the `name` is used for debugging purposes. The `args` provided after the `opts` argument are forwarded to the `opts.create` function.

**Options:**

- **name** (optional) - a name for the pool - useful for debugging purposes
- **min** (default: 2) - minimum number of active resources in pool at any given time
- **max** (default: 10) - maximum number of concurrently active resources
- **create**([args...], [callback]) - a function that creates new resources (could return a new resource directly or a `Promise` or use the `callback` argument)
- **destroy**(resource, callback) (optional) - a function that is used to destroy resources (could return a `Promise` or use the `callback` argument for asynchronous destruction)
- **check**(resource, [callback]) (optional) - a function that is used to check a resource (should return a `true` if the resource is OK, or otherwise `false`; for asynchronous checks it could also return a `Promise` or use the `callback` argument)
- **events** (default: close, end, error, timeout) - a list of events that are listened to on each resource and - if called - lead to the destruction of the resource
- **creationTimeout** (default: 2000ms) - a timeout (in ms) for the creation of a resource
- **destructionTimeout** (default: 500ms) - a timeout (in ms) for the destruction of a resource
- **acquisitionTimeout** (default: 10000) -  a timeout (in ms) for the acquisition of a resource (0 = disabled - improves performance)
- **leakDetectionThreshold** (default: 30.000) - an amount (in ms) of time that a resource can be in use out of the pool before a error is thrown indicating a possible resource leak. (0 = disabled)
- **faultTolerance** (default: true) - whether failures while creating resources should be ignored and the creation retried or the errors returned and creation aborted

### pool.acquire([callback])

This method is used to acquire / request a resource from the pool. It returns a `Promise`. As soon as there is a resource available, the `Promise` gets resolved and (if provided) the `callback` called.

### pool.release(resource)

This method is used to release / return a `resource` back to the pool.

### pool.drain()

Gracefully shut down the pool.

### Example

Keep in mind that `jacuzzi` is generic, i.e., resources are neither limited to sockets nor to connections!

```js
var net = require('net')
var Pool = require('jacuzzi').Pool

var pool = new Pool({
  create: function(port, callback) {
    var socket = net.connect(4000, function() {
      callback(socket)
    })
    socket.setEncoding('utf8')
    socket.setTimeout(300000)
  },
  destroy: function(socket, callback) {
    if (!socket.localPort) callback()
    else socket.end(callback)
  },
  check: function(socket) {
    return !!socket.localPort
  }
})

pool.acquire(function(err, socket) {
  pool.release(socket)
})
```

## Balancer

A resource pool balancer.

```js
var Balancer = require('jacuzzi').Balancer
```

### new Balancer(opts)

Instantiates a new Balancer.

**Options:**

- **check**(resource, [callback]) (optional) - a function that is used to check a pool (should return a `true` if the pool is OK, or otherwise `false`; for asynchronous checks it could also return a `Promise` or use the `callback` argument)
- **acquisitionTimeout** (default: 10000) -  a timeout (in ms) for the acquisition of a resource (0 = disabled - improves performance)

### balancer.add(pool, priority)

This method is used to add a pool to the balancer. The `priority` argument affects the scheduling. The lowest number for `priority` indicates the highest priority. Pools with lower priority are only selected, if the higher ones are down. Multiple pools with the same priority a scheduled with first come first serve.

**Example:**

```js
balancer.add(a, 1)
balancer.add(b, 2)
balancer.add(c, 3)

balancer.acquire() // ~> a
balancer.acquire() // ~> a
balancer.acquire() // ~> a
...

// a goes down

balancer.acquire() // ~> b
balancer.acquire() // ~> c
balancer.acquire() // ~> b
balancer.acquire() // ~> c
...
```

### balancer.acquire([callback])

This method is used to acquire / request a resource from the balancer. It returns a `Promise`. As soon as there is a resource available, the `Promise` gets resolved and (if provided) the `callback` called.

### balancer.release(resource)

This method is used to release / return a `resource` back to its pool.

### Example

Keep in mind that `jacuzzi` is generic, i.e., resources are neither limited to sockets nor to connections!

```js
var net = require('net'), a, b, c
var opts = {
  create: function(port, callback) {
    var socket = net.connect(port, function() {
      callback(socket)
    })
    socket.setEncoding('utf8')
    socket.setTimeout(300000)
  },
  destroy: function(socket, callback) {
    if (!socket.localPort) callback()
    else socket.end(callback)
  },
  check: function(socket) {
    return !!socket.localPort
  }
}

var Balancer = require('jacuzzi').Pool
var balancer = new Balancer({
  check: function(pool) {
    // e.g. ping
    // pool.opts.args = [4001] (or 4002, 4003 respectively)
  }
})

balancer.add(a = new Pool('Pool A', opts, 4001), 1)
balancer.add(b = new Pool('Pool B', opts, 4002), 2)
balancer.add(c = new Pool('Pool C', opts, 4003), 2)

balancer.acquire(function(err, socket) {
  balancer.release(socket)
})
```
